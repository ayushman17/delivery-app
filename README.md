# Delivery App

A Delivery Web App that will calculate the shortest distance from each drop off spot

This project shows a map with traffic density from TomTom's traffic API.


A web app that calculates the distance between two addresses 


The final route is calculated using the “Routing API” which by default will do a “car”  route. It can calculate the routes for motorcycles, vans, trucks or pedestrians! the results will vary.  

Distance Matrix Routing ,is used to optimise our multiple deliveries by travel time. 


# Features
Simple web app using  TomTom Distance Matrix API to plan an optimal route between a list of addresses. 

Using TomTom Map SDK for Web, to show us the best route for us as the delivery driver, to drop off all three deliveries based on time, taking: 
1. The route into account 
2. The traffic on the roads into account. 
3. The traffic incidents on the roads into account
